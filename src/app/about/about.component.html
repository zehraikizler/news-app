        Classroom Teaching at Trabzon University as you continue reading in the
        section I started writing my first code with my interest. I learned
        HTML, CSS and Bootstrap and did a few projects in the Front-End area. I
        started learning SCSS and JavaScript to progress further in the software
        field. After being accepted to the Hi-Kod At√∂lye organized by the
        Kodluyoruz team, I started working on React.Js. I continued learning
        React.Js with my curiosity. I tried to support my development by
        participating in the trainings held in Trabzon Teknokent. I attended the
        React Bootcamp organized by Kodluyoruz. I am currently working as
        Frontend Developer at Kodline company. Detail i like to dwell on it and
        deal with the details. I never shy away from taking responsibility.
